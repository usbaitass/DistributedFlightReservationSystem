# DistributedAirplaneBooking

This project is based on Airplane Ticket Booking.

There were few techniques used, such as:
    Distributed Design of the servers using CORBA.
    You can run few servers on different machines to prevent the downtime.
    You can restart any server if necessary and it will join the service automatically.
    If one of the servers fail, it won't effect on the service.
    Customers able to book from the chosen server.
    The bookings are synchronized.
    It solves the problem of selling the same ticket to multiple customers.
