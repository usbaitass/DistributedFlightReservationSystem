# Distributed Flight Reservation System

<b>This project is based on Airplane Ticket Booking.</b>

There were few techniques used, such as:<br>
    Distributed Design of the servers using CORBA.<br>
    You can run few servers on different machines to prevent the downtime.<br>
    You can restart any server if necessary and it will join the service automatically.<br>
    If one of the servers fail, it won't effect on the service.<br>
    Customers able to book from the chosen server.<br>
    The bookings are synchronized.<br>
    It solves the problem of selling the same ticket to multiple customers.<br>
    More details you can check in Documentation folder which contains project requirements and design document.<br>
